== Marker

Why?
* Some users don't want to learn another markup language.  For us, it's easy.  For some, it's the end of the world.  I can't highlight and click?  Fuck.

What?
It aims to mimic MediaWiki markup, but is purposely different in several areas:
1. Marker is a grammar-based parser (treetop to be exact), so a lot of corner cases are handled differently (which I think is more consistent).  Examples:
* ''' bold '' bold-italic? ''' italic ''
* others from the grammar
2.
