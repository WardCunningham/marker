== Marker

Marker is a markup language parser designed for two needs:
# Need to mimic MediaWiki syntax
# Need to provide multiple output formats

Mimicing MediaWiki syntax is not exact.  One reason is that the MediaWiki
parser itself is very complicated and handles many cases specially.  It would
be very difficult to exactly copy the MediaWiki parser and it probably wouldn't
be worth the time because MediaWiki is intended for a wiki and needs to be
adapted to be used as a markup lanaguage--especially for multiple output
formats.  The purpose of mimicing MediaWiki syntax is so that users don't have
to learn more than one markup language, so the implementation doesn't *need* to
be exact anyway.

Marker differs from MediaWiki in several ways, because it is a grammar-based
implementation.  The grammar is written as a
Treetop[http://treetop.rubyforge.org/] parsing expression grammar (PEG).

Not implemented:
# Table of contents
# Tables

== Use

Parsing is done with either Marker.parse or Marker.parse_file.  Both parse
methods will return a parse tree that has to_html and to_s methods that
"render" the markup.  Both render methods will accept an options hash.

Example:
 >> require 'marker'
 => true
 >> m = Marker.parse "== heading ==\nparagraph with '''bold''' text"
 => Markup+...
 >> puts m.to_s
 heading
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 paragraph with *bold* text
 => nil
 >> puts m.to_html
 <h2>heading</h2>
 <p>paragraph with <b>bold</b> text</p>
 => nil

=== Templates

Templates are implemented as method calls to a templates module.  Each method
in the templates module is considered a template and can be called using the
"{{ name }}" syntax.  Each template method is expected to take three arguments:
the render format (:html or :text), an array of positional parameters, and a
hash of named parameters.  For example,
 module MyTemplates
   def logo( format, pos_params, name_params )
     case format
     when :html
       '<img src="/images/logo.png" />'
     else
       ''
     end
   end
 end

Template modules are passed to Marker by setting the +templates+ property:
 require 'my_templates'
 require 'marker'
 
 Marker.templates = Templates

If no template method is found, the template call is printed for debugging:
 >> puts Marker.parse( '{{t|one|two|name=val}}' ).to_s
 render:t( :text, ["one", "two"], {"name"=>"val"} )

=== Internal Links

Internal links are implemented as links with default prefixes.  The link prefix
is specified by setting the +link_base+ property:
 require 'marker'
 
 Marker.link_base = 'http://example.com/pages/'

 >> puts Marker.parse( '[[target|name]]' ).to_html
 <p><a href='http://example.com/pages/target'>name</a></p>

The link target is appended to the link prefix, along with a beginning '/'.  If
no link base is given, links are just the link target with a beginning '/'.
The link base can also be given as a render option.
